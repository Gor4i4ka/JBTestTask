The inspection allows users to generate DSL-style builders for instantiating Kotlin data
classes. DSL builders will be generated for data classes from the user project. The
user may choose for which data classes one wants to generate builders,
however all data classes used in the one the user wants to wrap will be processed as well.

<p>Usage of a DSL-style builder helps to increase the level of abstraction to easier create instances of complex classes.</p>
